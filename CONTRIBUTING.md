# 🤝 Contributing to Agent Platform Patterns
We appreciate your interest in contributing to the **Agent Platform Patterns** repository!

This project is a **community-driven effort** to document reusable, field-tested patterns for building secure, scalable, and explainable agentic AI systems.

We welcome your expertise — whether you're working on AI agent orchestration, quantum reasoning agents, secure toolchains, or LLM planners.

---

## 📌 Contribution Requirements

Each contribution must include:

1. **Pattern File**: Markdown file in `/patterns` using the provided `_template.md`.
2. **Diagram**: Mermaid diagram in `/diagrams` showing system interaction or flow.
3. **Code Example or Notebook**: Working sample in `/notebooks` (preferably `.ipynb`) that demonstrates the pattern’s logic or architecture.

---

## 🛠 How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repo and create a new branch.
2. Copy `_template.md` and rename it to your pattern name (e.g., `secure-prompt-filter.md`).
3. Fill in the sections — follow the writing guidelines below.
4. Add a diagram to `/diagrams/` and a notebook to `/notebooks/`.
5. Submit a **Pull Request** with the title `Add pattern: <your pattern name>`.

## 🧠 Writing Guidelines

- Write in clear, concise Markdown.
- Focus on real-world applicability.
- Include technical depth, not just theoretical ideas.
- Explain when *not* to use the pattern.

## 📎 Pattern Template Structure

Your Markdown file should include the following sections:

```markdown
# 🧠 Pattern Title

## 🧩 Problem
Describe the real-world issue this pattern solves.

## 🎯 Context
Where is this pattern applicable?

## ✅ Solution
What is the architecture or logic that solves the problem?

## 🗺️ Diagram
Mermaid diagram or architecture sketch (link to `/diagrams/<file>.mmd`) or embed it directly:


## 💡 Lessons Learned
Share what you learned implementing this pattern:
- What was harder than expected?
- What should someone *watch out for*?
- What tooling or logging helped?

## 🚫 When Not to Use
When this pattern is not a good fit. Explain any edge cases or anti-patterns:
- When this pattern becomes overkill
- Systems where simpler approaches are better
```
