## Scenario:
 A company deploys an MCP server in their cloud environment to interface with storage and databases. The MCP server is given a cloud IAM role with broad permissions (for example, full read/write to a storage bucket) to ensure it can perform all needed tasks. In practice, the MCP only needs read access for its typical function, but it has write/delete rights as well due to an overly broad role.

## Threat Landscape: 
An over-privileged identity for the MCP means that if the server is compromised or misused, the impact is much greater. For instance, if an attacker hijacks the MCP or its credentials, they could delete or encrypt large amounts of data (“instant data loss” scenario. Even without a full compromise, a bug or prompt injection could cause the AI to unintentionally perform destructive actions (like deleting files) because the permissions allow it. This violates the principle of least privilege and amplifies the damage from any security incident.
## Assets (A):
* A01: Cloud data stores under MCP’s management (e.g., blob storage containers, databases) – these could be modified or wiped due to excessive access.
* A02: Cloud IAM credentials/keys for the MCP service (which carry high privileges).
## Threat Actors (TA):
* TA01: External attacker who gains a foothold (through vulnerability or stolen credentials) on the MCP server – now able to leverage the broad permissions to exfiltrate or destroy cloud assets.
* TA02: Insider or malicious AI prompt – an internal user or even the AI itself (through faulty instruction) triggers unauthorized actions (like mass deletions), not out of malice but due to misconfiguration that doesn’t prevent it.
## Security Controls (C):
* C01: Least privilege enforcement – strictly limit the MCP’s cloud role to only the necessary actions (e.g., read-only if possible). Regularly audit and remove unnecessary rights.
* C02: Scoped API keys – use separate credentials for different functions with granular scopes, so even if one is stolen, it can’t perform everything.
* C03: Guardrails in code – implement confirmation steps or safety checks in the MCP server for destructive operations (e.g., require a second factor or explicit user confirmation for deletes).
* C04: Cloud alerts – set up alerts for unusual MCP actions (deleting large volumes, accessing resources it normally doesn’t) to catch misuse early.
## Zones:
Cloud Environment (MCP server running with IAM role – protected zone)
Cloud Services (storage, databases – protected but accessible by MCP’s identity)
Attacker Zone (could be external internet or an already compromised internal host initiating the exploit)
